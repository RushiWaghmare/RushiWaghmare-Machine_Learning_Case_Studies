Welcome to **Machine Learning Case Studies** by Rushikesh Waghmare!  
This repository contains multiple **practical projects** demonstrating Machine Learning algorithms applied to **real-world datasets**.  

---

## üîπ Overview

This repository is designed for **learning and hands-on practice** in Machine Learning.  
It includes **case studies** covering:

- **Supervised Learning: Classification**  
- **Supervised Learning: Regression**  
- **Unsupervised Learning: Clustering (K-Means)**  
- **Ensemble Learning (Boosting, Random Forest, Heterogeneous Models)**  

All projects include datasets, Python scripts, and visualizations for better understanding.
